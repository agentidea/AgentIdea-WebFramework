	Framework - Python Edition v1


We ascribe this notion, that modular frameworks are useful.  Code is well organized and core plumbing is provided for basic request response, ( async model to follow )
.  Lazy instantion of commands by name allows for a particlarly nice consitent way to call logic

		#Python example calling testCommand with two parameters
		c = Command("testCommand")
        c.addParameter("name","grant")
        c.addParameter("birthday",(3,2,1967))
        print c.JSON
		
		#commands are passed to a central processor to run 'testCommand'
		

JavaScript calling details are in /src/docs/framework/coreFrameworkFolder.txt
